- **Search Bills**: Retrieve previous bills based on bill numbers.
- **Delete Bills**: Remove outdated or incorrect bills from the system.
- **Save Bills**: Store bills securely in files for future reference.
- **Customizable**: Add or modify item details as per your requirements.

## How It Works

1. **Main Menu**: Offers options to create, search, delete, or view bills.
2. **Bill Generation**: Includes functions to add items, calculate totals, and print receipts.
3. **File Management**: Saves bills in a text file for record-keeping and retrieval.

## File Structure

- **Header**: Includes customer name, bill number, and date.
- **Body**: Lists purchased items with name, quantity, price, and total.
- **Footer**: Displays the grand total, including taxes and discounts (if applicable).
